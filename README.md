# Validation-Simulation-Tools-
Mechanical &amp; thermo‑elastic validation suite (Python + C++, parallel). Runs closed‑form baselines (beams, springs, SDOF, thermal strain) against your solver or rig with randomized sweeps, CI‑friendly pass/fail, JUnit output, and OpenMP/multiprocessing speedups for fast, reproducible gates.
